# Digital IC Design of a 4-bit ALU Using Cadence

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using CMOS technology in **Cadence**. The design incorporates basic logic gates and different types of adders, including **Ripple Carry Adder**, **Carry Select Adder**, and **Carry Lookahead Adder**.

## Features

1. **Logic Gates Implementation**:
   - Basic CMOS logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR.
   - Multi-input gates and multiplexers: 2-to-1 MUX, 8-to-4 MUX, 16-to-4 MUX.

2. **Adder Design**:
   - Ripple Carry Adder: Simple and modular but slower due to carry propagation delay.
   - Carry Select Adder: Optimized for faster carry computation.
   - Carry Lookahead Adder: High-speed adder with minimal carry propagation delay.

3. **4-bit ALU Design**:
   - Performs arithmetic and logical operations based on the control signals.
   - Includes addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.

4. **CMOS Implementation**:
   - CMOS transistor-level design for low power and high efficiency.

## Design Highlights

### 1. **Logic Gates**
   - All basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) were implemented at the transistor level using CMOS technology.
   - Each gate has been verified for functionality and optimized for delay and power consumption.

### 2. **Multiplexers**
   - Designed multiplexers with various input configurations (2-to-1, 8-to-4, and 16-to-4).
   - Multiplexers form the backbone of the ALU for operation selection.

### 3. **Adder Types**
   - **Ripple Carry Adder**:
     - Modular design with full adders cascaded.
     - Higher delay due to carry propagation through all stages.
   - **Carry Select Adder**:
     - Divides the addition process into smaller blocks with precomputed carry values.
     - Reduces delay compared to the ripple carry design.
   - **Carry Lookahead Adder**:
     - Computes carry signals in parallel using the "generate" and "propagate" method.
     - Provides the fastest performance among the three.

### 4. **4-bit ALU**
   - Combines the above components (logic gates, multiplexers, and adders) to perform operations such as:
     - Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction.
     - Logic: AND, OR, XOR, NOT.
   - Controlled via a 4-bit operation select signal.

## How to Use the Project

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Cadence Virtuoso**: Installed and configured for digital IC design.
- **Cadence ADE-L/ADE-XL**: For simulation and verification.
- **Technology Library**: Set up according to your design node.

### 2. Setting Up the Environment
1. Load the project in **Cadence Virtuoso**:
   - Open Virtuoso and load the provided library (`.oalib`).
   - Ensure the `cdsinfo.tag` is correctly referenced in your Cadence environment.

2. Import the components:
   - Each folder (`AND`, `OR`, etc.) contains circuit schematics.
   - Open these designs to view, modify, or simulate individual components.

3. Compile and link the library:
   - Use the **Library Manager** in Cadence to view the hierarchical design.
   - Ensure all cells (MUXes, gates) are compiled correctly.

### 3. Simulating the Design
1. Use **ADE-L** to configure the simulation:
   - Load the **4-bit ALU top-level design**.
   - Apply input vectors to test various operations.

2. Verify functionality:
   - Check waveform results to validate logical correctness.
   - Test for all possible 4-bit input combinations.

3. Perform DRC and LVS:
   - Run **DRC** (Design Rule Check) to ensure layout compliance.
   - Perform **LVS** (Layout vs Schematic) to verify the design matches the schematic.

### 4. Design Hierarchy
- **Logic Gates**:
  - Basic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR, and NOR.
- **Multiplexers**:
  - Multi-bit MUX designs (`16to4MUX`, `8to4MUX`, etc.) for selecting operations.
- **Top-Level ALU**:
  - Combines logic gates and multiplexers to form the 4-bit ALU.
